Summary:
  This project contains Vim configuration files for editing and compiling Ruby
  within Vim.  See the project homepage for more details.

Web links:
  Homepage: http://vim-ruby.rubyforge.org
  Project:  http://www.rubyforge.org/vim-ruby

For regular users:
  - The project page should have two tarballs for download:
     - vim-ruby-stable.tar.gz (the files ready for the next Vim release)
     - vim-ruby-devel.tar.gz  (cutting-edge features we'd like you to test)
  - Please give feedback through the bug tracking and feature request features
    of RubyForge.
  - Feel free to join discussions on the vim-ruby-devel mailing list.
    Instructions on how to join are in the project page somewhere.
  - RubyForge also features forums, but the mailing list is better.

For would-be contributors:
  - Please get the latest from anonymous CVS.
  - Please join the mailing list and discuss changes, submit patches, etc.
  - Thank you very much for taking an interest.

Contents of the project:
  - The compiler, ftplugin, indent and syntax directories contain the ruby.vim
    files that are to be copied somewhere Vim can see them.
  - install.rb performs this copying.
  - build.rb creates a tarball for easy distribution.

How you get these files into Vim:
  - By downloading the project via a snapshot or anonymous CVS, you can keep
    up with the latest, make changes, and install the files to a Vim
    directory.
  - By downloading one of the tarballs, you can easily install the latest
    stable or development version wherever you like on your machine.  No
    README, no install.rb, just Vim files.  You would typically install these
    wherever Vim is installed, in the (for example) "vim62" directory.
  - Remember that when you install Vim in the first place, all of these files
    are present.  The purpose of downloading and installing them from
    RubyForge is to get the latest version of them.

Understanding the configuration files:
  - See www.rubygarden.org/ruby?VimRubySupport

CVS topics:
  - Files are tagged according to which version of Vim they are released in.
  - The project was initiated in July 2003, when the current version of Vim
    was 6.2.  Thus every file began its life tagged as vim6_2.
  - Modifications to the files are made in the expectation that they need to
    be tested by interested users.  They therefore (probably) don't have a
    tag, and are available via "cvs update -A", or a development snapshot.
  - When a modification is considered stable, it is tagged "stable".
    Everything that is stable gets released in vim-ruby-stable.tar.gz files.
  - When a new version of Vim is about to be released, the stable tarball is
    contributed to it.  After it has been released, the files are tagged
    accordingly.
  - MORAL OF THE STORY: modifications are committed to the head of the tree;
    when they are ready for release into userland, they are tagged "stable".

Any questions or suggestions?
  - If there's something about the project or its concepts that you don't
    understand, send an email to the project maintainer, Gavin Sinclair
    (gsinclair at soyabean.com.au).
  - To ask about the contents of the configuration files, ask on the mailing
    list, as different people maintain the different files.  Gavin knows
    nothing about the syntax file, for instance.

Project gossip:
  - Two of the configuration file maintainers, Doug Kearns and Gavin Sinclair,
    live in Australia (Melbourne and Sydney respectively).  Tim Hammerquist,
    the last man standing, has a cpan.org email address.
  - While the individual effort to maintain these files has a long history,
    this actual project began in late July 2003.  Therefore, if you're reading
    this soon thereafter and something doesn't make sense, now is the time to
    let us know.
